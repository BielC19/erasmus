                <p>Dear Isabel and Joan,<br><br>
                    I am <span>Biel Costa</span> from 1r of Batxllerat A. I am a student of the center since 2019 . I collaborated in the Erasmus+ project last year with the Estonian students Regarding academics, I am a disciplined sudent, I always want to achieve academically and in sports. In this letter, as you asked us, I will tell you why I’m the best option for the 2 month exchange program. If it is not possible, I have the intention to apply to the Erasmus+ weekly project. 
                    I believe I am a good candidate for the following reasons. I have a good level of English, since I went to Ireland for three months. In this opportunity, I could improve my level of oral communication in the language. I also enjoyed making friends from different countries, like Ireland, Italy, Germany, France and Ukraine, for example. With them, I talked a lot about the differences on the education system, languages, culture, laws, and some politics… 
                    <br>Moreover, once in Ireland, I didn’t have conflicts in any aspect.  I could complete the school subjects without difficulties, as it can be seen on my final report.
                    <br>Furthermore, I have very good habits of work and sport because I play Waterpolo more than 15 hours a week. With the time  I have left I to do the homework, study, learn programming, read and play video games.  
                    <br>My waterpolo team has won lots of competitions in different regions, and even national tournaments. We had the opportunity to be selected on the Catalonia tournament, where only the 8 best teams of all the region are selected to play against each other. 
                    <br>
                    <br>One of my hobbies is programming, as you can see with this website that I have created coding. I try to dedicate a little bit of time every day, but I am learning a lot. I know some programming languages like<strong> Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong> and a little bit of <strong>Linux. </strong>
                    <br>Not only do I like the informatic, I also enjoy to repair things like electronics or working with wood, iron… I also like engoy cooking a lot.
                    <br>
                    <br>In the near future, I’m thinking of studying computer science but I am not sure if I will do it in Spain or if I'll move abroad. One of my choices is the  university of Norway with a friend. Also, if I can, I will go to the United States in case I am selected with a scholarship of waterpolo that I would do without hesitation. 
                    <br>And if you finally choose me, I will make sure to take advantage of this experience by only talking foreigner languages. Despite already being able to speak in English, I will do my best to learn other languages, since I believe I will benefit from it. When I’m there I will try to make good friends because I wish I can go to visit them when the Erasmus+ finishes, like I did with an Italian friend that I met in Ireland.
                    <br>
                    <br>Thank you for your consideration and your time, I hope you consider me as one of your cadidates because I will love and benefit from this experience.  
                <br>
                <br>Thanks for all. <br>Kind regards Biel Costa Samsó.
                </p>
