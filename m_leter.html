            <p>Dear Isabel and Joan,
                I am Biel Costa from 1r of Batxllerati A. I am a student of the center since2019 .I collaboratedin the Erasmus+ project last year with the Estonian students Regarding academics, I am a good student who enjoys sportIn this letter, as you asked us, I will tell you why I’m the best option for the 2 month exchange program. If it is not possible, I have the intention to apply to the Erasmus+ weekly project. 
                I believe I am a good candidate for the following reasons. I have a good level of English, since I went to Ireland for three months. In this opportunity, I could improve my level of oral communication in the language.  I also enjoyed making friends from different countries, like Ireland, Italy, Germany, France and Ukraine, for example. With them, I talked a lot about the differences of the education system, languages, culture, laws, and some politics… 
                Moreover, once in Ireland, I didn’t have conflicts in any aspect.  I could complete the school subjects without difficulties, as it can be seen on my final report.
                Furthermore, I have very good habits of work and sport because I play Waterrpolo more than 15 hours a week. With the time  I have left I to do the homework, study, learn programming, read and play video games.  
                My waterpolo team have won lots of competitions in different areas of the region, and even national tournaments. We had the opportunity to be selected on the Catalonia tournament, where only the 8 best teams of all the region are selected to play against each other. 
                
                One of my hobbies is programming, as you can see with this website that I created coding. I try to dedicate a little bit of time every day, but I am learning a lot. I know some programming languages like Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a little bit of Linux.
                Not only do I like the informatic things, but I also enjoy to repair things like electrics or working with wood, iron… 
                
                For the near future, I’m thinking of studying computer science but I am not sure if I will do it in Spain or if I'll move abroad. One of my choices is the  university of Norway with a friend. Also, if I can, I will go to the United States in case I am selected with a scholarship of waterpolo that I would do without hesitation. 
                And if you finally choose me, I will make sure to take advantage of this experience by only talking foreigner languages. Despite already being able to speak in English, I will do my best to learn other languages, since I believe I will benefit from it. When I’m there I will try to make good friends because I wish I can go to visit them when the Erasmus+ finishes, like I did with an Italian fiend that I met in Ireland.
                
                Thank you for your consideration and your time, I hope you consider me  it and I hope more that you chose me because I can take a lot of profit to this experience I hope so too because I believe I am a very hard-working person.
